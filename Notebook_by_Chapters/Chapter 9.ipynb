To determine the $K_m$ and $V_{max}$ for this enzyme, and assuming that the concentration of phosphate ion is typically not limiting in the cell, we construct samples with differing concentrations of deoxyuridine in addition to a constant amount of enzyme and the appropriate buffers. After a set period, we stop the reaction (with sodium hydroxide in this case) and measure the amount of uracil via spectrophotometry (uracil can be detected by illumination at A290). Dividing the amount of uracil by the length of time, we obtain $v$, the rate of uracil production. A plot of deoxyuridine concentration vs. $v$ generated in my lab is shown in Figure 9.8. Notice that the shape of these data roughly resembles the Michaelis-Menten curve (it’s real data though, so yes, there are outliers!).\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Zetf312fsLan"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["![Figure 9](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1gjsdXQi-_qylbCnINi9Y7kg1dp_XKs4y)"],"metadata":{"id":"d9eO4HrqZ83a"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["> **Figure 9.8.

As shown in Figure 9.12, if the ratio between [$I_0$] and $K_I$ is one, then $K_m$ is multiplied by 2, enough to significantly reduce the rate of product formation if [$S_0$] is comparable to or less than $K_m$.

The invariance of matrix S is markedly different from the other kinetic parameters we’ve discussed, the determination of which can vary widely, depending on the experimental conditions and strategy, as well as on the laboratory – or even the individual – performing the assay. However, as long as the genome (and consequently, the metabolic network of the cell) remains the same, matrix S will be constant.
